# React + Vite

SpaceApp is a website that contains photos from the universe, like: galaxies, moons, stars, nebulaes, etc. It was developed by Fabio (Me), and the technology used was ReactJs + Vite. In SpaceApp, you can see the photos all gruped or sectorized.
I developed this website with the help from Alura, one of the biggest programming schools in Brazil.
